## Reinforcement Learning
- The notebook in Pacman-group11.rar file.

This project aims to train an AI agent to play the Atari 2600 game "Alien" using reinforcement learning 
techniques. The goal is to navigate through a maze-like environment, collect dots (destroy alien eggs), 
avoid enemies, and utilize power-ups to gain temporary advantages. The Atari 2600 game "Alien" 
serves as an ideal experiment due to its simplicity, well-defined rules, and clear objectives. By tackling 
this project, we can explore the capabilities of AI agents in solving complex real-world problems and 
gain insights into the application of deep reinforcement learning in-game environments

In this project, we trained a reinforcement learning agent to play Pac-Man using the DQN 
algorithm with various techniques such as replay buffer, warmup episodes, and window size. 
We conducted several trials with different hyperparameter settings and evaluated the agent's 
performance under varying conditions.
